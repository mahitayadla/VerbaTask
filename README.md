# VerbaTask
VerbaTask turns raw meeting transcripts into structured, tracked action items automatically. It was built on Elasticsearch Agent Builder and runs a pipeline of four specialized agents at the moment a transcript is uploaded. It extracts the tasks, summarizes discussions, validates deadlines and answers questions across all your meetings
